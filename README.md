1. Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your machine (if you don't, follow the instructions on the [MongoDB Website](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/))
2. Clone the repo
3. Install dependencies with `npm -i`
4. Run `npm start` to run the server and make the API live
5. Use your browser or an app like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test the REST 
API.
